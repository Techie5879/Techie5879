Hello World! You know me as Aritra. Currently a senior CS Undergrad at IIESTS, and 20 years old. I've programming (in some form) for about 9 (?) years ago now. Extremely interested in ML Research and new problems, and always exploring the frontier of Deep Learning. When I'm not training neural networks, I'm probably training my coffee-drinking skills ‚òï

I'm very interested in the areas of XAI (Mechanistic Interpretability), Computer Vision, Information Retrieval and LLMs. I've been a DAAD WISE Scholar 2024 at Technical University of Munich, working on Computer Vision, ML Research Intern at IIT Kharagpur and Quantum Computing Research Intern at ISI Kolkata. I've also worked with LLMs and built production-grade solutions over the past 1.5 years (almost as soon as LLMs emerged into the mainstream) as an MLE at Mercor, where I also developed and improved the IR pipeline for sifting through thousands of documents at scale. Currently working on a few research problems and trying to do some independent research. Here's my [resume](https://techie5879.github.io/uploads/resume.pdf)

Always on the lookout for hard problems and collaborators, so feel free to reach out if you find me interesting!


### üî¨ My research interests
- üëÅÔ∏è Teaching computers to see (Computer Vision) - because who doesn't want a robot that can appreciate art?
- üó£Ô∏è Making AI explain itself (XAI & Mechanistic Interpretability) - "Because I said so" doesn't cut it anymore
- ü¶ú Trying to dissect LLMs because I think scale wont get us to AGI. Explainability might.
- üë©‚Äçüíª Trying to improve code completion so I can relax more often

### Other Interests
I love movies. and Batman. might start a blog soon (maybe). 

Other than that, my interests probably just lie in exploring various challenges like Chollet's ARC-AGI Challenge, listening to MLST and Lex Fridman. I used to like reading books but haven't got the time to do so lately, maybe I get back into it soon. Oh and I like photography.
